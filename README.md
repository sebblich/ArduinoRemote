# ArduinoRemote
Here I just have some short and simple code that can be used for a sort of Arduino TV-remote,
though it only turns on lights on a breadboard, as it is used for a school project i.e. they only have cheap parts.

There isn't really much more to it.
If you can use the code, then use it. :)
